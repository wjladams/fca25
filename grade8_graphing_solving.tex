\textbf{Instructions:} For each system of equations below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane
    \item Find the point of intersection
    \item Verify your solution by checking it in both equations
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 1:} Solve by graphing:
\begin{align*}
    y &= 2x + 1 \\
    y &= -x + 4
\end{align*}

\vspace{0.4in}

\textbf{Problem 2:} Solve by graphing:
\begin{align*}
    y &= \frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\
    y &= x - 1
\end{align*}

\vspace{0.4in}

\textbf{Problem 3:} Solve by graphing:
\begin{align*}
    2x + y &= 4 \\
    x - y &= 5
\end{align*}

\textbf{Problem 4:} A movie theater charges \$8 for adult tickets and \$5 for child tickets. On one night, they sold a total of 200 tickets and collected \$1,400. Graph the system of equations and find how many adult and child tickets were sold.

\textit{Hint: Let $x$ = number of adult tickets and $y$ = number of child tickets}
\begin{align*}
    x + y &= 200 \\
    8x + 5y &= 1400
\end{align*}

\textbf{Challenge:} For Problem 4, explain how you know your answer makes sense in the context of the problem. What would an impossible solution look like?
